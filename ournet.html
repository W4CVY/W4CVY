            <p>Is there any emergency or priority traffic? <span class="instruction">(Pause)</span></p>

            <p>This net is open to all hams with privileges on this frequency.  
              <br>We meet every Wednesday at 8:00 PM Eastern Time on the 146.880 Columbus Amateur Radio Club repeater.  
              This repeater has a minus offset and 123 PL tone.
              <br>The alternate repeater frequency is 146.745 Russell County Amateur Radio Club repeater, 
                also with a minus offset and 123 tone.  
              <br>In the event that both repeaters are down we will meet on 146.550 simplex.
            </p>

            <p>The purpose of the net is to train members to be proficient during emergencies, encourage fellowship, and disseminate important information.  
              <span class="arrl_broadcast"><br>Additionally, we will relay the "ARRL Broadcast" after the Technical Corner portion of the net.</span>

            <p>This is a directed net, so please direct all traffic to the net control station.  
              <br>This is not a traffic handling net, however we will be glad to pass any traffic listed.
